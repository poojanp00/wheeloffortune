## Wheel Of Fortune

## General Overview
In Wheel of Fortune, the user attempts to accumulate as much money as possible by “spinning a wheel” and guessing letters in an attempt to figure out a secret phrase. Money will be awarded to the player for correct guesses, and deducted for incorrect guesses. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the phrase or has guessed all possible letters. 

At the beginning of a game, the program will randomly select a puzzle phrase and identify its corresponding category. Throughout the game, you will be earning  “winnings” by spinning a wheel and correctly guessing letters. After the phrase has been selected and printed to the screen with the appropriate blanks (along with the category and current winnings), you will be asked if you would like to Spin the Wheel, Buy a Vowel or Solve the Puzzle with the options "spin", "vowel", and "solve", respectively.
